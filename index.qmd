## Philosophy

We provide end-to-end tutoring and consulting that meets students where
they are and moves them toward measurable results. Our work spans
regular and Honors/AP courses, SAT/ACT preparation, college-essay
support, and ongoing academic coaching. Every engagement begins with a
brief diagnostic and goals conversation; from there we build a clear
weekly plan that blends concept-first explanations with targeted
practice, spaced-repetition review, and simple analytics‚Äîweekly
checkpoints, timing/accuracy tracking, and milestone reflections‚Äîso
progress is visible to students and families. For test prep, we teach
efficient strategies, pacing, and error analysis alongside content
mastery; for essays, we guide topic discovery, narrative structure, and
line-level polish until the draft is submission-ready; and for academic
coaching, we focus on systems that last‚Äîplanning, note-making, and time
management‚Äîso students learn how to learn and carry those habits into
every class.

## About Us

Ajay earned his B.A. in Statistics and Applied Mathematics (Data Science
emphasis) from the University of California, Berkeley (‚Äô25). Over the
past six years, he has taught and mentored students across AP and
college-level math/CS, starting as a volunteer instructor in high
school, leading review sessions at UC Berkeley, and later founding a
peer-tutoring program that consistently lifted grades and confidence.
